# Android-Encryption-Playground
This is a light weight POC / Playground app. I need to figure out how to encrypt data on an Android while providing the keys instead of using the built-in generation. 

### Current Known issues
 1. java.security.KeyStoreException: Protection parameters must be specified when importing a symmetric key
   a. The encryption works but the system throws an error every time.
